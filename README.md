#Project Proposal

##Elevator Pitch
Have you ever wanted to explore the world as a curious cat, venturing into a brand new scenery outside your usual home? A Cat's Quest is a cozy top-down game where you can adventure through town by solving puzzles, completing quests, and meeting fellow cat-friends.

##Game Synopsis
You find a butterfly flying, chasing after it until… You realize you can’t find your way back. Lost in an unfamiliar town, you can explore, complete various quests, and solve puzzles to level up. Instead of combat, this game focuses on a cozy vibe by interacting with other cats and progressing through the story by completing quests. The storyline involves moving into a new town and being outside for the first time, having to explore your new environment.

**Objective**
The goal is to find your way back home by discovering this new environment and exploring your way around by solving puzzles, speaking with characters, and finding clues.

**Mechanics**
Players can control their character around freely, exploring each scene and picking up items that can lead them to solve their way into the next scene and explore their way around. They can talk to certain characters to add to the storyline or make friends who assist them in their quest. 

**Conceptual Mock-Up**
Below is an example of what the first scene would look like as soon as you step out of the house and start exploring, before encountering any characters and puzzles. This is when the cat is chasing the butterfly.
